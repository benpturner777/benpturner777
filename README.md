# Introduction 
Hi, my name is Ben Turner and welcome to my Github page! I'm a mathematics student based in the UK, and this is essentially a portfolio of my mathematical ideas applied through python code. Most of my work consists of the numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries

# Current Work
Currently, I am working on university coursework where I am using Python ot construct trees to approximate continuous time stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations in order to solve problems arising in finance.  

Additionally, I am using python to analyse the stability and error of various numerical techniques (e.g. the local truncation and total error of a particular integration method or the region of stability for a Runge-Kutta method) for analysis.
